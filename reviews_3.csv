Review
I'd love to go back.
I will come back here every time I'm in Vegas.
I checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed.
I don't think we'll be going back anytime soon.
I hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives.
"Overall, I like this place a lot."
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides Costco's.
It's NOT hard to make a decent hamburger.
There is so much good food in Vegas that I feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to Rice and Company.
"This isn't a small family restaurant, this is a fine dining establishment."
I love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes.
I can't wait to go back.
"Needless to say, we will never be back here again."
Hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in.
"I don't have very many words to say about this place, but it does everything pretty well."
Coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties can't wait for the other person to ask to break up.
I left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day.
"Needless to say, I won't be going back anytime soon."
I've never been treated so bad.
"Overall, I like there food and the service."
"When I opened the sandwich, I was impressed, but not in a good way."
"Same evening, him and I are both drastically sick."
I just wanted to leave.
"It's close to my house, it's low-key, non-fancy, affordable prices, good food."
I will not be eating there again.
Ryan's Bar is definitely one Edinburgh establishment I won't be revisiting.
This is some seriously good pizza and I'm an expert/connisseur on the topic.
"I could barely stomach the meal, but didn't complain because it was a business lunch."
The waitress and manager are so friendly.
The only thing I did like was the prime rib and dessert section.
There is nothing authentic about this place.
"This place is a jewel in Las Vegas, and exactly what I've been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here."
I love the decor with the Chinese calligraphy wall paper.
I would avoid this place if you are staying in the Mirage.
I got food poisoning here at the buffet.
Wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside.
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever.
Based on the sub-par service I received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business I won't be going back.
"(It wasn't busy either) Also, the building was FREEZING cold."
"All in all, I can assure you I'll be back."
"I live in the neighborhood so I am disappointed I won't be back here, because it is a convenient location."
"This really is how Vegas fine dining used to be, right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed."
"I find wasting food to be despicable, but this just wasn't food."
Just had lunch here and had a great experience.
It sure does beat the nachos at the movies but I would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant.
The Buffet at Bellagio was far from what I anticipated.
Paying $7.85 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kid's meal at the Wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal.
"Although I very much liked the look and sound of this place, the actual experience was a bit disappointing."
It's a great place and I highly recommend it.
This is one of the better buffets that I have been to.
"I ate there twice on my last visit, and especially enjoyed the salmon salad."
The Macarons here are insanely good.
I wasn't really impressed with Strip Steak.
I love their fries and their beans.
"Every time I eat here, I see caring teamwork to a professional degree."
I like Steiners because it's dark and it feels like a bar.
The service here is fair at best.
We loved the place.
"Overall, I was very disappointed with the quality of food at Bouchon."
Tonight I had the Elk Filet special...and it sucked.
"I have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would I ever return to, and this tops the list."
It's too bad the food is so damn generic.
"I always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner, which has a wide array of options to choose from."
Shrimp- When I unwrapped it (I live only 1/2 a mile from Brushfire) it was literally ice cold.
"Great place to eat, reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the San Francisco Bay Area."
"It was so bad, I had lost the heart to finish it."
This was my first time and I can't wait until the next.
Not tasty and the texture was just nasty.
"As for the service, I thought it was good."
I can't tell you how disappointed I was.
But I definitely would not eat here again.
They were golden-crispy and delicious.
"Perhaps I caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews, but I'm not inspired to go back."
This place is horrible and way overpriced.
The pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old.
I ordered the Voodoo pasta and it was the first time I'd had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago.
"Anyway, I do not think i will go back there."
We won't be going back.
this place is good.
Horrible - don't waste your time and money.
Today is the second time I've been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good.
The grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning.
I don't know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea.
My first visit to Hiro was a delight!
If she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed... Not sure if we will go back and try it again.
"Also, I feel like the chips are bought, not made in house."
"No, I'm going to eat the potato that I found some strangers hair in it."
My boyfriend and I came here for the first time on a recent trip to Vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service.
Both of the egg rolls were fantastic.
I'm not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place.
Great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting.
The steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at GC.
I had the chicken Pho and it tasted very bland.
The refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland.
"This place is not worth your time, let alone Vegas."
"At first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe - nice ambiance, clean, friendly staff."
"Also, the fries are without a doubt the worst fries I've ever had."
I've lived here since 1979 and this was the first (and last) time I've stepped foot into this place.
The chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat I have ever eaten.
I'll take my business dinner dollars elsewhere.
I had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so I will not be getting that again.
If there were zero stars I would give it zero stars.
"too bad cause I know it's family owned, I really wanted to like this place."
This place should honestly be blown up.
Their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite.
"On the up side, their cafe serves really good food."
"This place is like Chipotle, but BETTER."
The service here leaves a lot to be desired.
I will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone!
I am far from a sushi connoisseur but I can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food.
"They have a plethora of salads and sandwiches, and everything I've tried gets my seal of approval."
"I don't know what the big deal is about this place, but I won't be back ""ya'all""."
I miss it and wish they had one in Philadelphia!
"The pizza tasted old, super chewy in not a good way."
We ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything.
"The chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless, seemed thin and watered down with no heat."
I've had better bagels from the grocery store.
"And considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about $20, you just can't go wrong."
I went to Bachi Burger on a friend's recommendation and was not disappointed.
"It was extremely ""crumby"" and pretty tasteless."
No one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it.
"I tried the Cape Cod ravoli, chicken, with cranberry...mmmm!"
I think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough.
By this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse.
So in a nutshell: 1) The restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer.
The ambiance was incredible.
I liked the patio and the service was outstanding.
We walked away stuffed and happy about our first Vegas buffet experience.
I would not recommend this place.
I would not recommend this place.
We sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left.
The waiter wasn't helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us.
"It was a bit too sweet, not really spicy enough, and lacked flavor."
"In fact I'm going to round up to 4 stars, just because she was so awesome."
I just don't know how this place managed to served the blandest food I have ever eaten when they are preparing Indian cuisine.
"As much as I'd like to go back, I can't get passed the atrocious service and will never return."
"I had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill, but unfortunately the taste fell flat, way flat."
The warm beer didn't help.
"When my order arrived, one of the gyros was missing."
"I had a salad with the wings, and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied."
I won't try going back there even if it's empty.
This place is way too overpriced for mediocre food.
Special thanks to Dylan T. for the recommendation on what to order :) All yummy for my tummy.
"It's like a really sexy party in your mouth, where you're outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party."
Once you get inside you'll be impressed with the place.
It was way over fried.
"The salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop, which was perfectly cooked."
"What did bother me, was the slow service."
The only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach.
"Not a weekly haunt, but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while."
I loved the bacon wrapped dates.
I really enjoyed eating here.
My salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of Palm.
"After waiting an hour and being seated, I was not in the greatest of moods."
"The meat was pretty dry, I had the sliced brisket and pulled pork."
"He was extremely rude and really, there are so many other restaurants I would love to dine at during a weekend in Vegas."
"The food was great as always, compliments to the chef."
"In summary, this was a largely disappointing dining experience."
We'll never go again.
This place deserves no stars.
Their frozen margaritas are WAY too sugary for my taste.
Today was my first taste of a Buldogis Gourmet Hot Dog and I have to tell you it was more than I ever thought possible.
"After one bite, I was hooked."
Nargile - I think you are great.
The only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive.
She ordered a toasted English muffin that came out untoasted.
"At least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving, and it wasn't that busy."
Overall I was not impressed and would not go back.
I believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi.
The potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer.
"However, there was so much garlic in the fondue, it was barely edible."
The buffet is small and all the food they offered was BLAND.
Kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did.
Nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food.
We won't be going back anytime soon!
"The food was barely lukewarm, so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us."
I also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack.
Their daily specials are always a hit with my group.
"The chips that came out were dripping with grease, and mostly not edible."
I love the Pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try.
The last 3 times I had lunch here has been bad.
It was just not a fun experience.
"Both of them were truly unbelievably good, and I am so glad we went back."
They know how to make them here.
Our server was super nice and checked on us many times.
This is a good joint.
"On three different occasions I asked for well done or medium well, and all three times I got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate."
We watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us.
"If you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service, then this is the place for you."
My fiancé and I came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away.
The feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best.
The service was terrible though.
After two I felt disgusting.
"Sadly, Gordon Ramsey's Steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to Vegas."
"I go to far too many places and I've never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast, especially for $4.00."
Those burgers were amazing.
It kept getting worse and worse so now I'm officially done.
"In an interesting part of town, this place is amazing."
"That said, our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased."
The food was terrible.
The food was terrible.
The lighting is just dark enough to set the mood.
"Unfortunately, it was not good."
"seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food, but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere."
I did not expect this to be so good!
"The dining space is tiny, but elegantly decorated and comfortable."
"By this point, my friends and I had basically figured out this place was a joke and didn't mind making it publicly and loudly known."
Any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one.
We asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didn't bring that either.
We will not be coming back.
"Lobster Bisque, Bussell Sprouts, Risotto, Filet ALL needed salt and pepper..and of course there is none at the tables."
Not a single employee came out to see if we were OK or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food.
These were so good we ordered them twice.
"I personally love the hummus, pita, baklava, falafels and Baba Ganoush (it's amazing what they do with eggplant!)."
"I have eaten here multiple times, and each time the food was delicious."
"I kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes, yet still no food."
The one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading.
I found this place by accident and I could not be happier.
"I have been in more than a few bars in Vegas, and do not ever recall being charged for tap water."
Service was fantastic.
"Poor service, the waiter made me feel like I was stupid every time he came to the table."
I'm not really sure how Joey's was voted best hot dog in the Valley by readers of Phoenix Magazine.
"A couple of months later, I returned and had an amazing meal."
My girlfriend's veal was very bad.
Why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked?
Four stars for the food & the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe & still letting us in to eat !
"It lacked flavor, seemed undercooked, and dry."
First time going but I think I will quickly become a regular.
The yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh.
Crostini that came with the salad was stale.
"The first time I ever came here I had an amazing experience, I still tell people how awesome the duck was."
There was a warm feeling with the service and I felt like their guest for a special treat.
It was absolutely amazing.
Food was so gooodd.
"Friend's pasta -- also bad, he barely touched it."
I won't be back.
I won't be back.
Talk about great customer service of course we will be back.
The food came out at a good pace.
The restaurant atmosphere was exquisite.
I came back today since they relocated and still not impressed.
"- Really, really good rice, all the time."
"To my disbelief, each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods I have ever tasted."
I was so insulted.
"Perfect for someone (me) who only likes beer ice cold, or in this case, even colder."
Now this dish was quite flavourful.
"On the good side, the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic - a real treat."
Service was fine and the waitress was friendly.
"Frozen pucks of disgust, with some of the worst people behind the register."
"The chicken I got was definitely reheated and was only ok, the wedges were cold and soggy."
Del Taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible.
"It took over 30 min to get their milkshake, which was nothing more than chocolate milk."
This greedy corporation will NEVER see another dime from me!
"I hate to disagree with my fellow Yelpers, but my husband and I were so disappointed with this place."
I want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service.
This place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer.
My friend loved the salmon tartar.
I had about two bites and refused to eat anymore.
Last night was my second time dining here and I was so happy I decided to go back!
The waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for vegan/veggie options.
"for 40 bucks a head, i really expect better food."
The selection was probably the worst I've seen in Vegas.....there was none.
"We had fantastic service, and were pleased by the atmosphere."
The restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it.
"Our waiter was very attentive, friendly, and informative."
All of the tapas dishes were delicious!
"The whole experience was underwhelming, and I think we'll just go to Ninja Sushi next time."
"The owner used to work at Nobu, so this place is really similar for half the price."
Honeslty it didn't taste THAT fresh.)
"I guess I should have known that this place would suck, because it is inside of the Excalibur, but I didn't use my common sense."
These are the nicest restaurant owners I've ever come across.
"The burger... I got the ""Gold Standard"" a $17 burger and was kind of disappointed."
"I'd say that would be the hardest decision... Honestly, all of M's dishes taste how they are supposed to taste (amazing)."
My gyro was basically lettuce only.
They have great dinners.
"If you look for authentic Thai food, go else where."
Before I go in to why I gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at Bachi burger before writing a review.
Everyone is treated equally special.
"Worse of all, he humiliated his worker right in front of me..Bunch of horrible name callings."
This place deserves one star and 90% has to do with the food.
"The food is about on par with Denny's, which is to say, not good at all."
"If the food isn't bad enough for you, then enjoy dealing with the world's worst/annoying drunk people."
If you stay in Vegas you must get breakfast here at least once.
So flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat.
I can take a little bad service but the food sucks.
"I loved the grilled pizza, reminded me of legit Italian pizza."
Bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat.
"If that bug never showed up I would have given a 4 for sure, but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen."
"My side Greek salad with the Greek dressing was so tasty, and the pita and hummus was very refreshing."
As always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious!
The chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside.
"I probably won't be back, to be honest."
"They have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich, a crispy chicken wrap, a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers."
This is an unbelievable BARGAIN!
The nachos are a MUST HAVE!
They brought a fresh batch of fries and I was thinking yay something warm but no!
The worst was the salmon sashimi.
Everything was perfect the night we were in.
Tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse.
The folks at Otto always make us feel so welcome and special.
I was shocked because no signs indicate cash only.
"I had heard good things about this place, but it exceeding every hope I could have dreamed of."
Server did a great job handling our large rowdy table.
This is one of the best bars with food in Vegas.
"Then our food came out, disappointment ensued."
All I have to say is the food was amazing!!!
"I love the owner/chef, his one authentic Japanese cool dude!"
I don't have to be an accountant to know I'm getting screwed!
"No allergy warnings on the menu, and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts."
And the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasn't very tasty to me.
"Unfortunately, we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was STALE."
"The ripped banana was not only ripped, but petrified and tasteless."
I promise they won't disappoint.
The food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable.
"Try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy, friendly service."
"I got to enjoy the seafood salad, with a fabulous vinegrette."
"I had strawberry tea, which was good."
"Ordered a double cheeseburger & got a single patty that was falling apart (picture uploaded) Yeah, still sucks."
The goat taco didn't skimp on the meat and wow what FLAVOR!
It was awesome.
The cashier had no care what so ever on what I had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced.
"Love this place, hits the spot when I want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor."
I vomited in the bathroom mid lunch.
We started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasn't fresh.
I love this place.
I love this place.
The classic Maine Lobster Roll was fantastic.
"The service was a little slow , considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace."
We've have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant.
They also have the best cheese crisp in town.
The food wasn't good.
We won't be returning.
"My brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day, and guess what he was sick all night too."
"We also ordered the spinach and avocado salad, the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste."
The crêpe was delicate and thin and moist.
Delicious and I will absolutely be back!
The only downside is the service.
At least think to refill my water before I struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes.
I ordered the Lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible.
I've never been more insulted or felt disrespected.
"I don't each much pasta, but I love the homemade /hand made pastas and thin pizzas here."
Best of luck to the rude and non-customer service focused new management.
We waited for thirty minutes to be seated (although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting).
"Best Buffet in town, for the price you cannot beat it."
Your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me.
"However, my recent experience at this particular location was not so good."
"Maybe it's just their Vegetarian fare, but I've been twice and I thought it was average at best."
Highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron!
Definitely a turn off for me & i doubt I'll be back unless someone else is buying.
Just spicy enough.. Perfect actually.
I'm not eating here!
"Total letdown, I would much rather just go to the Camelback Flower Shop and Cartel Coffee."
"I was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar, not only because the quality is great, but the service is fast and the food, impeccable."
My drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions.
The place was fairly clean but the food simply wasn't worth it.
From what my dinner companions told me...everything was very fresh with nice texture and taste.
I really enjoyed Crema Café before they expanded. I even told friends they had the BEST breakfast.
"Then, as if I hadn't wasted enough of my life there, they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check."
OMG I felt like I had never eaten Thai food until this dish.
They had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and I liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle.
Food was average at best.
I hope this place sticks around.
Check it out.
After I pulled up my car I waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged.
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored.
I didn't know pulled pork could be soooo delicious.
-My order was not correct.
My boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience.
I paid the bill but did not tip because I felt the server did a terrible job.
Great service and food.
It was equally awful.
The management is rude.
We literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order.
Wow... Loved this place.
They were excellent.
Their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place.
I had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas!
"Third, the cheese on my friend's burger was cold."
I could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine.
This one is simply a disappointment.
An excellent new restaurant by an experienced Frenchman.
Hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didn't want to eat it for fear of getting sick.
It really is impressive that the place hasn't closed down.
Please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles.
We aren't ones to make a scene at restaurants but I just don't get it...definitely lost the love after this one!
I have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor.
"After 20 minutes wait, I got a table."
"They will customize your order any way you'd like, my usual is Eggplant with Green Bean stir fry, love it!"
It was a pale color instead of nice and char and has NO flavor.
Omelets are to die for!
"They could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish, but it was still very good."
I can assure you that you won't be disappointed.
Waiter was a jerk.
"Their menu is diverse, and reasonably priced."
"Main thing I didn't enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd, around mid 30s and up."
CONCLUSION: Very filling meals.
I will be back many times soon.
The RI style calamari was a joke.
The waitresses are very friendly.
This is an Outstanding little restaurant with some of the Best Food I have ever tasted.
What a mistake.
The staff was very attentive.
This is a GREAT place to eat!
Do not waste your money here!
The service was poor and thats being nice.
I ordered Albondigas soup - which was just warm - and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs.
Not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom.
Kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos!
The server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome... I would not suggest this place!
I guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful.
We got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy.
"The food sucked, which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined."
We could not believe how dirty the oysters were!
"Oh this is such a thing of beauty, this restaurant."
It's worth driving up from Tucson!
"How can you call yourself a steakhouse if you can't properly cook a steak, I don't understand!"
I think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking.
Now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty.
"The sides are delish - mixed mushrooms, yukon gold puree, white corn - beateous."
The pancake was also really good and pretty large at that.
"This place is pretty good, nice little vibe in the restaurant."
"I'd rather eat airline food, seriously."
There is nothing privileged about working/eating there.
Awesome service and food.
We were promptly greeted and seated.
The food is good.
They have a really nice atmosphere.
The fried rice was dry as well.
My wife had the Lobster Bisque soup which was lukewarm.
It wasn't busy at all and now we know why.
The servers are not pleasant to deal with and they don't always honor Pizza Hut coupons.
"I started this review with two stars, but I'm editing it to give it only one."
It was probably dirt.
Which are small and not worth the price.
It is worth the drive.
Service is also cute.
But then they came back cold.
Best fish I've ever had in my life!
"The staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries, lawyers, and court staff."
The cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked.
Wow very spicy but delicious.
I seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off.
My boyfriend tried the Mediterranean Chicken Salad and fell in love.
The food is very good for your typical bar food.
If you want a sandwich just go to any Firehouse!!!!!
Food was really good and I got full petty fast.
The food was very good.
The patio seating was very comfortable.
Service was slow and not attentive.
We had a group of 70+ when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully.
If someone orders two tacos don't' you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart?
I dont think I will be back for a very long time.
Food was below average.
Some may say this buffet is pricey but I think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot!
The seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree.
This is the place where I first had pho and it was amazing!!
"The only good thing was our waiter, he was very helpful and kept the bloddy mary's coming."
Everything was good and tasty!
"Phenomenal food, service and ambiance."
"Hawaiian Breeze, Mango Magic, and Pineapple Delight are the smoothies that I've tried so far and they're all good."
I've had better atmosphere.
The menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide!
The problem I have is that they charge $11.99 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a Subway sub (which offers better and more amount of vegetables).
"Thus far, have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time."
Now I am getting angry and I want my damn pho.
"Hot dishes are not hot, cold dishes are close to room temp.I watched staff prepare food with BARE HANDS, no gloves.Everything is deep fried in oil."
We waited for forty five minutes in vain.
"Great food and service, huge portions and they give a military discount."
"Service is quick and even ""to go"" orders are just like we like it!"
"When I'm on this side of town, this will definitely be a spot I'll hit up again!"
What I really like there is the crepe station.
Ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes.
I never come again.
The seafood was fresh and generous in portion.
"I gave it 5 stars then, and I'm giving it 5 stars now."
The desserts were a bit strange.
I love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it.
the presentation of the food was awful.
I'm not impressed with the concept or the food.
I'm super pissd.
I had a seriously solid breakfast here.
Great time - family dinner on a Sunday night.
Things that went wrong: - They burned the saganaki.
"Worst service to boot, but that is the least of their worries."
Our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff.
We had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast.
And the beans and rice were mediocre at best.
"One nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8, and they didn't expect more tip than that."
A FLY was in my apple juice.. A FLY!!!!!!!!
"Come hungry, leave happy and stuffed!"
"The service was great, even the manager came and helped with our table."
The turkey and roast beef were bland.
This place is disgusting!
I wouldn't return.
Service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see.
"Of all the dishes, the salmon was the best, but all were great."
"OMG, the food was delicioso!"
"If you want healthy authentic or ethic food, try this place."
"Strike 2, who wants to be rushed."
"The chains, which I'm no fan of, beat this place easily."
"The fries were not hot, and neither was my burger."
Once your food arrives it's meh.
The pizza selections are good.
"My breakfast was perpared great, with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of Toast, lightly dusted with powdered sugar."
"Anyways, The food was definitely not filling at all, and for the price you pay you should expect more."
The service was extremely slow.
The flair bartenders are absolutely amazing!
Just don't know why they were so slow.
"Took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was Luke warm, Our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed."
This is my new fav Vegas buffet spot.
"I've had better, not only from dedicated boba tea spots, but even from Jenni Pho."
Definitely not worth the $3 I paid.
"Give it a try, you will be happy you did."
Fantastic service here.
He deserves 5 stars.
I dressed up to be treated so rudely!
"Nice, spicy and tender."
I *heart* this place.
I will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night ... highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area.
I was seated immediately.
"They have horrible attitudes towards customers, and talk down to each one when customers don't enjoy their food."
"For service, I give them no stars."
"The burger had absolutely no flavor - the meat itself was totally bland, the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor."
We've tried to like this place but after 10+ times I think we're done with them.
"The food was very good and I enjoyed every mouthful, an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc."
A lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar In her salad.
The inside is really quite nice and very clean.
Service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is Vegas and located inside the Crystals shopping mall by Aria.
Waitress was a little slow in service.
This is a great restaurant at the Mandalay Bay.
"There is really nothing for me at postinos, hope your experience is better"
The croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus.
This place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver.
Update.....went back for a second time and it was still just as amazing
Con: spotty service.
Pricing is a bit of a concern at Mellow Mushroom.
"The wontons were thin, not thick and chewy, almost melt in your mouth."
The shrimp tender and moist.
I had a pretty satifying experience.
Pretty awesome place.
We ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside.
It was not good.
The cocktails are all handmade and delicious.
The Han Nan Chicken was also very tasty.
"The building itself seems pretty neat, the bathroom is pretty trippy, but I wouldn't eat here again."
After the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert.
Great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer.
"Also there are combos like a burger, fries, and beer for 23 which is a decent deal."
"I really do recommend this place, you can go wrong with this donut place!"
"Love the margaritas, too!"
"On the ground, right next to our table was a large, smeared, been-stepped-in-and-tracked-everywhere pile of green bird poop."
"Now the burgers aren't as good, the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless."
One of the few places in Phoenix that I would definately go back to again .
The manager was the worst.
Went for lunch - service was slow.
The ambiance isn't much better.
"Level 5 spicy was perfect, where spice didn't over-whelm the soup."
"On a positive note, our server was very attentive and provided great service."
It was delicious!!!
Food was great and so was the serivce!
"Good food , good service ."
Damn good steak.
The jalapeno bacon is soooo good.
And it was way to expensive.
Couldn't ask for a more satisfying meal.
"I LOVED their mussels cooked in this wine reduction, the duck was tender, and their potato dishes were delicious."
I got home to see the driest damn wings ever!
I would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza.
"We had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing, but was quickly disappointed."
My sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless.
Don't waste your time here.
Waitress was sweet and funny.
!....THE OWNERS REALLY REALLY need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one!
"The Wife hated her meal (coconut shrimp), and our friends really did not enjoy their meals, either."
Always a pleasure dealing with him.
We definately enjoyed ourselves.
Ordered burger rare came in we'll done.
We were sat right on time and our server from the get go was FANTASTIC!
By far the BEST cheesecurds we have ever had!
"If you're not familiar, check it out."
RUDE & INCONSIDERATE MANAGEMENT.
High-quality chicken on the chicken Caesar salad.
"What SHOULD have been a hilarious, yummy Christmas Eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us."
The atmosphere here is fun.
Each day of the week they have a different deal and it's all so delicious!
Some highlights : Great quality nigiri here!
They really want to make your experience a good one.
"Anyway, this FS restaurant has a wonderful breakfast/lunch."
"The staff are now not as friendly, the wait times for being served are horrible, no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes."
"Lastly, the mozzarella sticks, they were the best thing we ordered."
Nice ambiance.
"Our server was very nice, and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs, he stayed professional and friendly until the end."
We enjoy their pizza and brunch.
What a mistake that was!
The selection on the menu was great and so were the prices.
So good I am going to have to review this place twice - once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night.
Ambience is perfect.
This is a really fantastic Thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit.
This place is hands-down one of the best places to eat in the Phoenix metro area.
"All in all, Ha Long Bay was a bit of a flop."
The WORST EXPERIENCE EVER.
As a sushi lover avoid this place by all means.
The ambience is wonderful and there is music playing.
The cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing.
An extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast.
"As for the service: I'm a fan, because it's quick and you're being served by some nice folks."
Awful service.
The staff are also very friendly and efficient.
How awesome is that.
I probably won't be coming back here.
The bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated.
Eew... This location needs a complete overhaul.
Everything was fresh and delicious!
"the food is not tasty at all, not to say its ""real traditional Hunan style""."
I was disgusted because I was pretty sure that was human hair.
This is a disgrace.
"He also came back to check on us regularly, excellent service."
Everything was gross.
Won't ever go here again.
"not even a ""hello, we will be right with you."""
"Will never, ever go back."
2 times - Very Bad Customer Service !
"Very convenient, since we were staying at the MGM!"
Nothing special.
We loved the biscuits!!!
Don't bother coming here.
My ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor.
"I have been here several times in the past, and the experience has always been great."
"Plus, it's only 8 bucks."
I can say that the desserts were yummy.
This place is great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well.
Their chow mein is so good!
I consider this theft.
The plantains were the worst I've ever tasted.
"Overall, a great experience."
Good Service-check!
Best tacos in town by far!!
Bacon is hella salty.
Great place fo take out or eat in.
The poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying.
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating.
WAAAAAAyyyyyyyyyy over rated is all I am saying.
"The burger is good beef, cooked just right."
When I received my Pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there.
There was hardly any meat.
The black eyed peas and sweet potatoes... UNREAL!
The chefs were friendly and did a good job.
"Seriously flavorful delights, folks."
Won't go back.
Avoid at all cost!
Much better than the other AYCE sushi place I went to in Vegas.
I recently tried Caballero's and I have been back every week since!
The only thing I wasn't too crazy about was their guacamole as I don't like it puréed.
The atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested.
Great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with TV's.
"Lordy, the Khao Soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers!"
"Very good food, great atmosphere.1"
WILL NEVER EVER GO BACK AND HAVE TOLD MANY PEOPLE WHAT HAD HAPPENED.
"Similarly, the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late."
"Furthermore, you can't even find hours of operation on the website!"
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit.
The Veggitarian platter is out of this world!
"Went in for happy hour, great list of wines."
We'd definitely go back here again.
Have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome!!
The place was not clean and the food oh so stale!
"I mean really, how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when it's so terrible!?!"
"To summarize... the food was incredible, nay, transcendant... but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser."
The bus boy on the other hand was so rude.
The vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole (choux) pastry was fresh enough.
Very good lunch spot.
"Good service, very clean, and inexpensive, to boot!"
Never had anything to complain about here.
I don't think I'll be running back to Carly's anytime soon for food.
"You get incredibly fresh fish, prepared with care."
Great Pizza and Salads!
Fantastic food!
What a great double cheeseburger!
The steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked.
Google mediocre and I imagine Smashburger will pop up.
My fella got the huevos rancheros and they didn't look too appealing.
The cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me.
"Everyone is very attentive, providing excellent customer service."
"The food is delicious and just spicy enough, so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way."
"Good value, great food, great service."
The bartender was also nice.
"The food, amazing."
I had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas.
My husband said she was very rude... did not even apologize for the bad food or anything.
I don't recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving.
This place is two thumbs up....way up.
After all the rave reviews I couldn't wait to eat here......what a disappointment!
"i felt insulted and disrespected, how could you talk and judge another human being like that?"
Would come back again if I had a sushi craving while in Vegas.
Very very fun chef.
Extremely Tasty!
Service sucks.
very tough and very short on flavor!
The sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as I have had.
We recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well.
If you are reading this please don't go there.
Penne vodka excellent!
This place is amazing!
"This is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged, then another 35 minutes to get our food...and they kept forgetting things."
My friend did not like his Bloody Mary.
Bland... Not a liking this place for a number of reasons and I don't want to waste time on bad reviewing.. I'll leave it at that...
"As for the ""mains,"" also uninspired."
"And the drinks are WEAK, people!"
Good beer & drink selection and good food selection.
The real disappointment was our waiter.
Generous portions and great taste.
"For about 10 minutes, we we're waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasn't coming any time soon."
This was my first and only Vegas buffet and it did not disappoint.
This place receives stars for their APPETIZERS!!!
"The service was terrible, food was mediocre."
The food was excellent and service was very good.
The chips and sals a here is amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
It was packed!!
We waited an hour for what was a breakfast I could have done 100 times better at home.
"Not much flavor to them, and very poorly constructed."
"Back to good BBQ, lighter fare, reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways."
And the chef was generous with his time (even came around twice so we can take pictures with him).
Seriously killer hot chai latte.
I waited and waited.
Maybe if they weren't cold they would have been somewhat edible.
You won't be disappointed.
"If you love authentic Mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting, yet delicious meats to choose from, you need to try this place."
- They never brought a salad we asked for.
"I also had to taste my Mom's multi-grain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing, fluffy, and delicious!"
Service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews.
Food was really boring.
Great food and awesome service!
Eclectic selection.
The fries were great too.
It also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it.
And service was super friendly.
We made the drive all the way from North Scottsdale... and I was not one bit disappointed!
Service stinks here!
Go To Place for Gyros.
I work in the hospitality industry in Paradise Valley and have refrained from recommending Cibo any longer.
Waited 2 hours & never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did!
Boy was that sucker dry!!.
But the service was beyond bad.
Cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable.
"Despite how hard I rate businesses, its actually rare for me to give a 1 star."
Food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small.
This place lacked style!!
"It was either too cold, not enough flavor or just bad."
Will go back next trip out.
Do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish.
I asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored I went to the hostess and got one myself.
AN HOUR... seriously?
"like the other reviewer said ""you couldn't pay me to eat at this place again."""
Service was good and the company was better!
"The atmosphere is modern and hip, while maintaining a touch of coziness."
All the bread is made in-house!
The Greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful.
The scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well.
"This was my first crawfish experience, and it was delicious!"
A great touch.
"The chips and salsa were really good, the salsa was very fresh."
Very disappointing!!!
I LOVED it!
Not my thing.
Don't do it!!!!
"REAL sushi lovers, let's be honest - Yama is not that good."
"a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food, but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait."
I could care less... The interior is just beautiful.
The selection of food was not the best.
Seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh.
Will not be back!
Terrible management.
Dessert: Panna Cotta was amazing.
But I don't like it.
The owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous.
- the food is rich so order accordingly.
We are so glad we found this place.
Will not be back.
Soggy and not good.
"All in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service, a unique menu, and a beautiful setting."
"A greasy, unhealthy meal."
This place has it!
"Very good, though!"
Would not go back.
Just as good as when I had it more than a year ago!
"Your servers suck, wait, correction, our server Heimer sucked."
"The staff is great, the food is delish, and they have an incredible beer selection."
The live music on Fridays totally blows.
It is PERFECT for a sit-down family meal or get together with a few friends.
Overall I wasn't very impressed with Noca.
She was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door.
I was mortified.
"Very, very sad."
Join the club and get awesome offers via email.
Def coming back to bowl next time
I will not return.
Favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma!!!!!!
Mediocre food.
"The food was delicious, our bartender was attentive and personable AND we got a great deal!"
The steak was amazing...rge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had!
Worst martini ever!
TOTAL WASTE OF TIME.
"I do love sushi, but I found Kabuki to be over-priced, over-hip and under-services."
Left very frustrated.
But now I was completely grossed out.
"If it were possible to give them zero stars, they'd have it."
Sauce was tasteless.
"We got sitting fairly fast, but, ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order, another 30 minutes before the food arrived."
I found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa.
Good prices.
"The decor is nice, and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant."
did not like at all.
Their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter... Mmmm...!
A fantastic neighborhood gem !!!
Spend your money and time some place else.
The price is reasonable and the service is great.
"In the summer, you can dine in a charming outdoor patio - so very delightful."
The service was outshining & I definitely recommend the Halibut.
The vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic Thai.
"The staff is always super friendly and helpful, which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby!"
They also now serve Indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world.
"Great steak, great sides, great wine, amazing desserts."
Never going back.
The tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu.
Not good by any stretch of the imagination.
"Point your finger at any item on the menu, order it and you won't be disappointed."
What happened next was pretty....off putting.
It was a huge awkward 1.5lb piece of cow that was 3/4ths gristle and fat.
"Great Subway, in fact it's so good when you come here every other Subway will not meet your expectations."
A great way to finish a great.
"Not to mention the combination of pears, almonds and bacon is a big winner!"
I was VERY disappointed!!
I'll definitely be in soon again.
You cant go wrong with any of the food here.
"Stopped by this place while in Madison for the Ironman, very friendly, kind staff."
DELICIOUS!!
For that price I can think of a few place I would have much rather gone.
Their steaks are 100% recommended!
Cant say enough good things about this place.
"This hole in the wall has great Mexican street tacos, and friendly staff."
Pretty good beer selection too.
That's right....the red velvet cake.....ohhh this stuff is so good.
The sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well.
Very poor service.
So don't go there if you are looking for good food...
I probably would not go here again.
"The deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks, and Jeff went above and beyond what we expected."
"Overall, I don't think that I would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that I silently felt too."
"Bad day or not, I have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people, it is your job to be nice and polite, wash dishes otherwise!!"
Will be back again!
"Delicious NYC bagels, good selections of cream cheese, real Lox with capers even."
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean.
"I know this is not like the other restaurants at all, something is very off here!"
I took back my money and got outta there.
Worst food/service I've had in a while.
Im in AZ all the time and now have my new spot.
"This place is not quality sushi, it is not a quality restaurant."
Interesting decor.
Appetite instantly gone.
"Never been to Hard Rock Casino before, WILL NEVER EVER STEP FORWARD IN IT AGAIN!"
It'll be a regular stop on my trips to Phoenix!
"It was attached to a gas station, and that is rarely a good sign."
So absolutley fantastic.
The Jamaican mojitos are delicious.
"Definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly, will return next time I'm in Vegas."
"Cute, quaint, simple, honest."
Great pork sandwich.
Great food.
Overpriced for what you are getting.
Would not recommend to others.
"Be sure to order dessert, even if you need to pack it to-go - the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for."
it was a drive to get there.
"Great food for the price, which is very high quality and house made."
"Host staff were, for lack of a better word, BITCHES!"
So they performed.
"The shower area is outside so you can only rinse, not take a full shower, unless you don't mind being nude for everyone to see!"
Awesome selection of beer.
"The service was not up to par, either."
"The chicken dishes are OK, the beef is like shoe leather."
Great brunch spot.
"The sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was $12, ridiculous."
"Classy/warm atmosphere, fun and fresh appetizers, succulent steaks (Baseball steak!!!!!"
"Probably never coming back, and wouldn't recommend it."
So we went to Tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon!
Service is quick and friendly.
Gave up trying to eat any of the crust (teeth still sore).
Best tater tots in the southwest.
Over rated.
Reasonably priced also!
-Drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point.
Stopped by during the late May bank holiday off Rick Steve recommendation and loved it.
5 stars for the brick oven bread app!
"That just SCREAMS ""LEGIT"" in my book...somethat's also pretty rare here in Vegas."
I swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed.
Very friendly staff.
Worst Thai ever.
This wonderful experience made this place a must-stop whenever we are in town again.
Spend your money elsewhere.
If you haven't gone here GO NOW!
And then tragedy struck.
Must have been an off night at this place.
The roast beef sandwich tasted really good!
Weird vibe from owners.
He was terrible!
Ample portions and good prices.
Total brunch fail.
Nicest Chinese restaurant I've been in a while.
Highly recommended.
Everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter.
"The staff are great, the ambiance is great."
"The ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting, but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits."
"I have watched their prices inflate, portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly!"
"Our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow, he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go!"
Sooooo good!!
Owner's are really great people.!
"Also were served hot bread and butter, and home made potato chips with bacon bits on top....very original and very good."
Very Very Disappointed ordered the $35 Big Bay Plater.
Pretty cool I would say.
"Prices are very reasonable, flavors are spot on, the sauce is home made, and the slaw is not drenched in mayo."
"We thought you'd have to venture further away to get good sushi, but this place really hit the spot that night."
first time there and might just be the last.
First - the bathrooms at this location were dirty- Seat covers were not replenished & just plain yucky!!!
Service is friendly and inviting.
My husband and I ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service.
Service was very prompt.
Best breakfast buffet!!!
Always a great time at Dos Gringos!
Disappointing experience.
Only Pros : Large seating area/ Nice bar area/ Great simple drink menu/ The BEST brick oven pizza with homemade dough!
"Great atmosphere, friendly and fast service."
2 Thumbs Up!!
There is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again.
You can't beat that.
very slow at seating even with reservation.
dont go here.
"This place is overpriced, not consistent with their boba, and it really is OVERPRICED!"
"I'm so happy to be here!!!"""
The potato chip order was sad... I could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12.
"Sorry, I will not be getting food from here anytime soon :("
Never again will I be dining at this place!
Restaurant is always full but never a wait.
Crust is not good.
"The guys all had steaks, and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak he's ever eaten."
When my mom and I got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad.
The best place to go for a tasty bowl of Pho!
"For a self proclaimed coffee cafe, I was wildly disappointed."
"Unfortunately, it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees."
"Food was good, service was good, Prices were good."
He came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table.
Tasted like dirt.
"The descriptions said ""yum yum sauce"" and another said ""eel sauce"", yet another said ""spicy mayo""...well NONE of the rolls had sauces on them."
I'm probably one of the few people to ever go to Ians and not like it.
Waited and waited and waited.
"The menu is always changing, food quality is going down & service is extremely slow."
It was pretty gross!
Not good for the money.
It shouldn't take 30 min for pancakes and eggs.
Food quality has been horrible.
No complaints!
"Loved it...friendly servers, great food, wonderful and imaginative menu."
Probably not in a hurry to go back.
This place was such a nice surprise!
I as well would've given godfathers zero stars if possible.
The service was meh.
I immediately said I wanted to talk to the manager but I did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar.
"The servers went back and forth several times, not even so much as an ""Are you being helped?"""
(The bathroom is just next door and very nice.)
"The best place in Vegas for breakfast (just check out a Sat, or Sun."
Very bad Experience!
They dropped more than the ball.
definitely will come back here again.
The service was a bit lacking.
"Insults, profound deuchebaggery, and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it."
"For sushi on the Strip, this is the place to go."
A good time!
Terrible service!
An absolute must visit!
will definitely be back!
Hell no will I go back
Food was delicious!
This was like the final blow!
AVOID THIS ESTABLISHMENT!
Thoroughly disappointed!
Food arrived quickly!
I give it 2 thumbs down
* Both the Hot & Sour & the Egg Flower Soups were absolutely 5 Stars!
Waitress was good though!
The block was amazing.
say bye bye to your tip lady!
The Burrittos Blah!
Hands down my favorite Italian restaurant!
The Heart Attack Grill in downtown Vegas is an absolutely flat-lined excuse for a restaurant.
Both great!
I would recommend saving room for this!
you can watch them preparing the delicious food!)
I think not again
The kids play area is NASTY!
The portion was huge!
"Best service and food ever, Maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day."
